# Honors-Thesis
Synthesizer Parameter Approximation by Deep Learning

Project for honors thesis spring 2021

##Phase 1
Synthesizer Creation with JUCE Framework: https://juce.com/
The synthesizer will be a command line application that generates samples

##Phase 2
Data set generation.
A variety of audio samples will be generated to input and test the deep learning network.

##Phase 3
Deep learning module
The deep learning module will be created with tensor flow
